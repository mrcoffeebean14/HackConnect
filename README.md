## ✅ **How to Use This**

🔑 **Keep it updated** — after each phase, tick your roadmap items.  
📸 **Add screenshots & Loom walkthrough** once deployed.  
🌐 **Add your live Vercel/Render links** once you deploy.

This makes your GitHub repo look **professional**, clear, and *job-ready*.

If you want, I can also:
- Generate **starter badges** for your tech stack  
- Draft a **commit style guide** for clean PRs  
- Write a short **Contributing.md** template too

Just say **“Agent, add it!”** — and we’ll do it.
